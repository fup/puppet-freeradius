#  listen: Make the server listen on a particular IP address, and send
#  replies out from that address. This directive is most useful for
#  hosts with multiple IP addresses on one interface.
#
#  If you want the server to listen on additional addresses, or on
#  additionnal ports, you can use multiple "listen" sections.
#
#  Each section make the server listen for only one type of packet,
#  therefore authentication and accounting have to be configured in
#  different sections.
#
#  The server ignore all "listen" section if you are using '-i' and '-p'
#  on the command line.
#
listen {
  #  Type of packets to listen for.
  #  Allowed values are:
  # auth  listen for authentication packets
  # acct  listen for accounting packets
  # proxy   IP to use for sending proxied packets
  # detail  Read from the detail file.  For examples, see
  #               raddb/sites-available/copy-acct-to-home-server
  # status  listen for Status-Server packets.  For examples,
  #   see raddb/sites-available/status
  # coa     listen for CoA-Request and Disconnect-Request
  #   packets.  For examples, see the file
  #   raddb/sites-available/coa-server

  type = <%= @type %>

  #  Note: "type = proxy" lets you control the source IP used for
  #        proxying packets, with some limitations:
  #
  #    * A proxy listener CANNOT be used in a virtual server section.
  #    * You should probably set "port = 0".
  #    * Any "clients" configuration will be ignored.
  #
  #  See also proxy.conf, and the "src_ipaddr" configuration entry
  #  in the sample "home_server" section.  When you specify the
  #  source IP address for packets sent to a home server, the
  #  proxy listeners are automatically created.

  #  IP address on which to listen.
  #  Allowed values are:
  # dotted quad (1.2.3.4)
  #       hostname    (radius.example.com)
  #       wildcard    (*)
  ipaddr = <%= @listen_ip %>

<%- if @listen_ipv6 %>
  #  OR, you can use an IPv6 address, but not both
  #  at the same time.
  ipv6addr = <%= @listen_ipv6 %> # any.  ::1 == localhost
<%- end %>
  #  Port on which to listen.
  #  Allowed values are:
  # integer port number (1812)
  # 0 means "use /etc/services for the proper port"
  port = <%= @port %>

<%- if @interface %>
  #  Some systems support binding to an interface, in addition
  #  to the IP address.  This feature isn't strictly necessary,
  #  but for sites with many IP addresses on one interface,
  #  it's useful to say "listen on all addresses for eth0".
  #
  #  If your system does not support this feature, you will
  #  get an error if you try to use it.
  #
  interface = <%= @interface %>

<%- if @clients %>
  #  Per-socket lists of clients.  This is a very useful feature.
  #
  #  The name here is a reference to a section elsewhere in
  #  radiusd.conf, or clients.conf.  Having the name as
  #  a reference allows multiple sockets to use the same
  #  set of clients.
  #
  #  If this configuration is used, then the global list of clients
  #  is IGNORED for this "listen" section.  Take care configuring
  #  this feature, to ensure you don't accidentally disable a
  #  client you need.
  #
  #  See clients.conf for the configuration of "per_socket_clients".
